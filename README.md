## Introduction

Evanescent is a Minecraft client project that takes MCP 1.8.9 and rewrites it in Kotlin/JVM. This rewrite is designed to offer optimized performance, enhanced readability, and improved conciseness. Powered by the Gradle Kotlin DSL, it ensures smooth dependency setup and fast compilation. We've also integrated OptiFine to save developers valuable time and natively support IntelliJ IDEA.

#### JDK Version and Dependencies

Evanescent uses the latest LTS JDK (currently version 17) and keeps dependencies up to date to ensure the best performance and security.

## In-built Features

- ✅ Removed Minecraft Realms support.
- ✅ Removed hit delay.
- ✅ Removed right-click delay.
- ✅ Simple Microsoft login in-game.
- ✅ Simple Automatic Sprint feature.

## Pending In-built Features (not limited to)

- ❌ Removed Twitch Broadcast support.
- ❌ Removed score display on the right side of the scoreboard.
- ❌ Implemented raw input.

## Why the Name "Evanescent"?

The name “Evanescent” means something that fades away quickly. We chose this name because this client is only a starting point for your own project, and you can customize it as you wish.

## Contributions

Contributions are greatly appreciated and mainly accepted in Kotlin/JVM. Feel free to contribute to the project and help make it even better!
