Evanescent is a Minecraft client project that takes MCP 1.8.9 and rewrites it in Kotlin/JVM. This rewrite is designed to offer optimized performance, enhanced readability, and improved conciseness. Powered by the Gradle Kotlin DSL, it ensures smooth dependency setup and fast compilation. We've also integrated OptiFine to save developers valuable time and provide native support for IntelliJ IDEA.

## JDK Version and Dependencies

Evanescent uses the latest LTS JDK (currently version 21) and keeps dependencies up to date to ensure the best performance and security.
